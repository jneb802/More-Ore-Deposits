# More Ore Deposits
The goal of this mod is to add additional small ore deposits to the world. You can mine the deposits just like you would any other and you'll also receive drops. Each ore deposit will be added during world generation (see known issues) and appear in its relevant biome. 


## Features
- Adds small gold ore deposit to the Blackforest biome
- Adds small iron ore deposit to the Swamp biome
- Adds small silver ore deposit to the Mountain biome
- Adds small blackmetal ore deposit to the Plains biome
- Adds gold ore item that drops from gold ore deposit. Gold ore can be smelted for gold coins.
- Translated in all 36 Valheim languages
