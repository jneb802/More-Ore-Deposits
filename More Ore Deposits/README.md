# More Ore Deposits
The goal of this mod is to add additional small ore deposits to the world. You can mine the deposits just like you would any other and you'll also receive drops. Each ore deposit will be added during world generation (see known issues) and appear in it's relevant biome. 


## Features
- Adds small gold ore deposit to the Blackforest, Swamp, and Mistlands biome

## Known issues
1. The ore deposits will not spawn on the first world generation. You must exit the world and then re-enter it to see them.
2. Not currently comptible with SmoothBrain's Mining skill mod. I would like to make them compatible but struggled to get the code working.
3. The hover text for the ores is not localized.
4. The hover text for the ores has square brackets around it.
